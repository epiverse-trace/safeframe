**safeframe** provides functions to tag and validate data of any kind.
safeframe is an abstraction of
[**linelist**](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist), which
originally applied these principles to epidemiological linelist data.
The original proposal for this package can be found on [the Discussion
board](https://github.com/orgs/epiverse-trace/discussions/221).

## Installation

You can install safeframe from CRAN (release) or GitHub (development):

``` r
# CRAN
install.packages('safeframe')

# Development
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/safeframe")
```

## Getting started

``` r
library(safeframe)

# Create a safeframe object
x <- make_safeframe(cars, mph = "speed", distance = "dist")

# Validate the tagged data are of a specific type
validate_safeframe(x,
  mph = 'numeric',        # speed should be numeric
  # type() is a helper function of related classes
  distance = type('numeric')    # dist should be numeric, integer
)
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently *maturing*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html):

> Package is functional, documented and tested. Can be used in
> production with the understanding that the interface may still undergo
> minor changes. Typically semantic version \< 1.0.0.

### Related projects

This project is related to other existing projects in R or other
languages, but also differs from them in the following aspects:

- [labelled](https://github.com/larmarange/labelled/): A package for
  tagging data in R, but it is more focused on tagging variables than
  validating them.
- [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist): A package for
  managing and validating linelist data - the original inspiration for
  safeframe.
- [struct](https://github.com/cynkra/struct): A package that ‚Äúprovides
  ways to modify objects more strictly, guaranteeing that we keep the
  type of the modified element.‚Äù
